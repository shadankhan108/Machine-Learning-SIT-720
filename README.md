# Machine-Learning-SIT-720

This repository contains coursework and datasets for the SIT720 Machine Learning unit. Each task is stored in its own folder together with the data used in the notebook.

## Repository Structure

- `Machine Learning/`
  - **Task2.1_ml.ipynb** – early exercises using a small weather dataset.
  - `WeatherData.csv` and its cleaned/encoded versions.
  - `loop_log.txt` – sample output from a Python loop example.
- `Machine Learning 4.1/`
  - **Machine Learning 4.1(new).ipynb** – data preprocessing and exploratory analysis for clustering.
  - `Dataset.csv` – fruit characteristics used in the notebook.
- **Machine Learning 4.1.ipynb** – an additional notebook demonstrating preprocessing on the same dataset.
- `machine learning 6.1p task/`
  - **task 6.1p(new).ipynb** – explores train/test splits, linear regression and PCA on an energy efficiency dataset.
  - `dataset.csv` – features X1–X8 with target variables Y1 and Y2.
- `Machine Learning 6.2c/`
  - **task 6.2c(New).ipynb** – clustering analysis on microclimate sensor data with PCA.
  - `microclimate-sensors-data.csv` – sensor readings such as wind speed, temperature and air quality.
- `Machine Learning 8.1p/`
  - **task_8.1p.ipynb** – principal component analysis and classification examples.
  - `Dataset3.csv` – student academic information for classification tasks.
- `MACHINE LEARNING 8.3D/`
  - **8.3D.ipynb** – evaluates multiple supervised learning models and feature importance on a network traffic dataset.
  - `Dataset4.csv` – network flow features with a `target` label.

## Usage

All tasks are implemented as Jupyter notebooks. To experiment with the notebooks:

1. Install Python 3 and common scientific libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, etc.).
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab in this repository directory.
3. Open any notebook (`*.ipynb`) and run the cells sequentially.

Large datasets (such as the microclimate and network traffic CSV files) are included for completeness and may take some time to load.
